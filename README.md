Glycopeptide Finder 3 main repository

### About
###### What is this
GPFinder 3 is a python script that implements an algorithm to assign
glycopeptide identities (peptide structure + glycan composition) by
their fragmentation mass spectra. 

###### Project Scope
While candidate glycopeptides can be found with a single tandem mass
spectrum, statistical significance of assignments as stated by a false
discovery rate can be determined using decoy analysis. As implemented
in GPF3, decoy analysis requires input from many spectra taken in a single
session, thus, in order to use decoy analysis, GPF3 requires data be
provided as with mass-chromatograms. Other tools exist to work with single
tandem spectra, I recommend glycopep grader made by Carrie Woodin of the
Desaire lab (http://glycopro.chem.ku.edu/GPGHome.php ).

### Tutorial
### Setting up an environment for GPF3

Prior to using GPF3 install all dependencies and their subdependencies. 

GP3 depends on Python 2.7, Numpy, and MatPlotLib.

Experienced Python users may be familiar with the process of installing
these dependnecies but for others, I recommend using a scientific python
distribution like Enthought Python Distribution. Others exist that include
these libraries. Importantly, GPF3 does not yet work with python 3.
